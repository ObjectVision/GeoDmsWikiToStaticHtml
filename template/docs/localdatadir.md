The LocalDataDir is the root folder for (temporary) results. Before the GeoDMS 8 serie is was also used for the CalcCache.

You can adjust the path on your local machine for the LocalDataDir from the [geodms-gui](geodms-gui) with the menu option: Tools > Options > Advanced Tab.

In your configuration you can use the [folders-and-placeholders](folders-and-placeholders) %LocalDataDir% to refer to this folder.
