The GeoDMS is developed for [geographic (spatial)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geography) calculations, modeling and visualization.
[operators-and-functions](operators-and-functions) are available to calculate with geographic data and the [geodms-gui](geodms-gui) contains a map view to visualize this type of data. More information on this map view can be found in the [user-guide](user-guide).

To work with geographic data, coordinates are used expressed in a [coordinate-system](coordinate-system).

## type of geographic data

The GeoDMS supports both working with
- [grid-data](grid-data)
- [vector-data](vector-data)

## coordinate ordering

- [xy-order](xy-order)
- [point-order-in-polygons](point-order-in-polygons)
