We encountered an issue with the command line parameters to jump to the correct [configuration-file](configuration-file) and or line in the file.

These parameters do sometimes not work if both a 32 and a 64 bits version of Notepad ++ are installed.

**Solution**: uninstall both versions and install only one new version.
