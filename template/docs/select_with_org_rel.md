*[selection-functions](selection-functions) select_with_org_rel*

## syntax

- select_with_org_rel(*condition*)
- select_uint8_with_org_rel(*condition*)
- select_uint16_with_org_rel(*condition*)
- select_uint32_with_org_rel(*condition*)
- select_uint64_with_org_rel(*condition*)

## definition

select_with_org_rel(*condition*) results in a new [domain-unit](domain-unit) with a [relation](relation) to the entries of the domain unit of the condition, for which the values of the *condition* [argument](argument) are true.

The resulting [value-type](value-type) of the domain unit is derived from the domain unit of the *condition* argument:

- uint32 for conditions with uint32, boolean, spoint or wpoint value type
- uint8 for conditions with uint8 value type
- uint16 for conditions with uint16 value type
- uint64 for conditions with uint64, ipoint or upoint value type

Between versions 8.44 and 8.7.2 the name [select_orgrel](select_orgrel) was used for the select_with_org_rel function. 

The explicit *select_uint8_with_org_rel*, *select_uint16_with_org_rel*, *select_uint32_with_org_rel* and *select_uint64_with_org_rel* functions can be used in the same manner as the select_with_org_rel function, to create a new domain unit with the explicit value type.

## description

The select_with_org_rel function generates a [subitem](subitem), named *org_rel*. This [data-item](data-item) contains the relation towards the domain unit of the *condition*  argument.

The select_with_org_rel and [subset](subset) functions are similar, the only difference is that the subitem generated by the subset operator is called: <I>Nr_OrgEntity</I>, a name that does not meet with our [naming-conventions](naming-conventions).    

The *org_rel* data item can be used in a [lookup](lookup) function to relate [attribute](attribute) to the new domain unit, see the example.

See this [selection-operator-comparison](selection-operator-comparison) for when to choose which selection operator is feasable.

## applies to

- *condition* must be a boolean attribute or [subexpression](subexpression) resulting in boolean values.

## since version

8.8.0

}
