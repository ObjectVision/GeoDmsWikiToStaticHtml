A grid is a two-dimensional data structure, representing a rectangular. 
A grid contains cells, defined by a row and a column number.

For images/pictures (think e.g. of bitmaps or png files) usually only local row and column numbers are relevant.

In a [GIS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographic_information_system) environment, a grid often represents a rectangle part of the world.

In the GeoDMS a grid is defined by a [grid-domain](grid-domain). Attributes with characteristics for the cells of the grid are called [grid-data](grid-data).
