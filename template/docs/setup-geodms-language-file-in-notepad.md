### GeoDMS language file

The GeoDMS language file is called: **GeoDMS_npp_def.xml**. 

It can be found in the same folder where your GeoDMS version is installed (default: %ProgramFiles%/ObjectVision/GeoDms<I>version</I>).

### import GeoDMS language file

1) Open Notepad++

2) Go to Language > User defined Language > Define your language.
