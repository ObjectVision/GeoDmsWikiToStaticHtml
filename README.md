# Intro
Github wiki content is generally not allowed to be indexed by third-parties like Google Search. GeoDmsWikiToStaticHtml is a tool to convert public Github wiki content to static html content. This allows the wiki content to be duplicated neatly and served at a location that allows for indexing, while keeping the source in one location.
